      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Five</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help protects Her devotees in all the
        <br />
        necessities and afflictions of life.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Let us consider that the world is a place of trial, a valley of tears
        and weeping. Who is unaware of it? " Man" says Job, " born of a woman,
        living for a short time, is filled with many works and miseries." His
        work is&nbsp; that of Calvary. Such is the condition of every mortal.
        That is why the author of the " Imitation of Christ" says: Man needs
        consolation. " And this consolation, where will our afflicted heart find
        it? Perhaps in our friends and neighbours? Ah, no! Usually, they look
        with indifference upon our tribulations; our tears do not move them, and
        if one of them is moved to compassion upon seeing our sorrow, often he
        does not know how to mitigate it in the least because he is impotent. Of
        whom can we ask for help in poverty, consolation in afflictions, counsel
        in doubts? Of whom but of Her Who is the Perpetual Help of mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, afflicted soul, see how the divine Infant clasps the hand of His
        tender Mother. He has seen the cross and the instrument of His passion
        that the angels present to Him, and He has become terrified, and His
        Heart has said: " My sorrow is always before My eyes." But where does He
        seek consolation? In His good Mother Who extends Her hand to Him to
        support and comfort Him in His suffering! Let us learn from the Heavenly
        Infant to have recourse to the compassionate Mother of Perpetual Help in
        our afflictions and trials. Perpetual are our miseries, but, oh,
        consolation! Perpetual also is her Help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poor soul! Do not be discouraged. Your Mother sees the many and varied
        calamities that grieve you. She sees what torment your body and afflicts
        your soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you poor? Neither the necessities of your family, nor the
        afflictions of your heart, nor the tears you shed for lack of means with
        which to procure food or to satisfy your creditor or to provide honestly
        for your children pass unnoticed by Her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you ill? She sees the pain that consumes you, the abhorrence that
        afflicts you, the fear that oppresses you, the days you pass without
        relief, the nights you count without rest. Are you the target of
        another's envy or anger? Are you calumniated? Do you find a reason for
        affliction within your own family? This compassionate Mother witnesses
        your bitterness, the injustices committed against you in tribunals, the
        harm your rivals cause you, and the outrage and offence you receive from
        your relatives. She counts your tear. This, with all the rest that
        afflicts you, She sees without withdrawing Her penetrating and benign
        glance from you for one moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        And She not only sees it, but it seems she feels it more vividly than
        you. A mother is of mercy, and that is why, just as She sees our
        miseries with the eyes of a mother with the heart of a mother, She
        sympathizes with them. In such a way that, just as at the foot of the
        cross, the wounds of the most sacred Body of Jesus were reflected in the
        loving Heart of Mary. Thus all the injuries of our wounded heart are
        reproduced in that of our Heavenly Mother. Finally, this tender Mother
        not only sees our miseries and our hearts open but is moved by our
        misfortune&nbsp; in a gesture of helping us with all haste.
      </p>
      <p>
        And She exercises this pious office with us continually. Is She doing
        anything but granting us help with our necessities? Ah! No matter how
        little we dedicate our thoughts to the many laborious evils we are
        subject to in life, we will see that in everything, She defends,
        relieves, and protects us. At the wedding at Cana, scarcely was She
        aware of the lack of wine, of the shame of the bridegroom and the
        disturbance of the guests; when moved to compassion, She presented that
        necessity to Her son, begging sweetly to apply the opportune remedy;
        thus, in the same way, now that She is seated gloriously at the right
        hand of Her Son in Heaven, She continually discloses to Him all our
        necessities. She begs Him to alleviate our miseries or provide powerful
        help to suffering them with humble resignation, as this or that may
        rebound to His greater glory and our spiritual good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well then: if such is the soothing effects that we experience every day
        from the loving help of Mary, what must be our gratitude towards a
        Mother so kind, what must be our affection for a Mother so tender, what
        must be our confidence in a Mother Who loves us so and concerns Herself
        so much with us? She has Her eyes always fixed on our miseries, Her
        Heart always disposed to be compassionate, and Her hands always open to
        remedy them. Let us have continuous and devout recourse then, to this
        most kind Mother, disclosing all our needs to Her with filial
        confidence. Let us be assured that through Her, we will have our
        perpetual relief, encouragement and consolation. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! Similarly, as a poor, ragged and wounded one
        presents himself to a great Queen, I present myself to Thee, Who art the
        Queen of Heaven and Earth. From the exalted throne where Thou art
        seated, I beg Thee, do not disdain to turn Thy merciful eyes toward this
        unhappy sinner. For that is why God has enriched Thee so much, to help
        the poor, and He has established Thee, Queen of Mercy, so Thou mayest
        alleviate the miserable. Behold me, then, and have mercy on me. I am not
        unaware that Thy merciful Heart finds consolation in aiding the
        miserable. Today, then, console Thy pious Heart and console me, too,
        since Thou has occasion to assist me. See, O tender Mother, the
        affliction of my heart; see my family's needs. There are so many causes
        for affliction in my own home and so much persecution on the part of my
        neighbours; illness torments my body, and interior pains devour my soul.
        To whom must I have recourse, O my Lady and Mother, but to Thee, Who art
        Mother of Perpetual Help? Allow me, then, to say with St. Bernard: "
        Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that
        anyone who fled to Thy protection, implored Thy help, or sought Thy
        intercession, was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly
        unto Thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother! To Thee, I come before Thee;
        I kneel, sinful and sorrowful. O mother of the word incarnate, despise
        not my petitions, but in Thy mercy, hear and answer me. Amen.

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of the year 1883, while the free-thinkers of the United
        States were celebrating their annual reunion in Rochester, and in their
        impious discourse were denying the existence of God and of His works,
        behold a marvellous event suddenly occurred that occupied the American
        press; it is the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the city of Boston, the director of a college had horrible cancer in
        her breast that had broken out in three places. The most distinguished
        doctors of Boston had examined the disease and judged it incurable
        unless there was a happy outcome to a surgical operation. The sick
        woman, although repugnant, had to consent to it; first, she began a
        novena to Our Lady Of Perpetual Help. Eight days had passed without the
        desired result, and the operation would be performed the following day.
        Several distinguished university professors, including its head, were to
        cooperate in this painful undertaking. They put the sick woman to sleep
        with a soporific drink and placed her on the operating table. The head
        surgeon was somewhat distant, and the surgeon assigned to begin that
        risky task asked him with which of the three wounds he was to start. "
        With the largest, he was answered" But behold the surgeon could not find
        any cancer. Very courageously, the head surgeon approached the sick
        woman and imagined his surprise when neither could he find any sign of
        the terrible disease; nevertheless, he affirmed solemnly to the doctors
        who were present that the previous evening and that very same morning he
        had seen three horrible cancers in the breast of the sick woman. He
        added that their appearance was a mystery to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        They released the sick woman and awakened her. Not feeling any pain, she
        asked why they released her. They assured her that the operation was not
        necessary. Having convinced herself of that fact, she began to thank Our
        Lady of Perpetual Help, declaring to the incredulous but stunned doctors
        that this was the work of the good Mother, in Whose honour a novena was
        coming to an end on that very same day.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
