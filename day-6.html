      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Six</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help sustains Her devotees in the practice of
        virtues.
      </strong>
      <p>
        If it were sufficient to avoid sin to be agreeable in everything to the
        Lord, the benign office of our Mother would stop at this; for this
        alone, She would provide Her Perpetual Help. But God is not content
        without being offended; He requires positive service; He wants us to be
        perfect: " Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect." and truly, He
        wants us to dedicate ourselves to the practice of these Christian
        virtues. But how many difficulties are encountered on the path that
        leads to the holy mountain of perfection? It seems that good, solely
        because it is good, is now contrary to our corrupt nature. Just soul who
        have consecrated yourselves to the practice of piety, have you not found
        it so? O! How arid and sterile is our heart, incapable of producing any
        fruit worthy of life eternal if the Heavenly waters of grace do not fall
        to fertilize it! When a soul truly wishes to sanctify itself, it
        renounces itself, advancing each day in perfection, experiencing what
        the author of the " Imitation of Christ" says: " that sanctification is
        not a child's play, nor the work of one day;" then it feels the need of
        perpetual and powerful help, of continual assistance. Ah, and this
        perpetual help, perchance, do we have it? Why do we withdraw? Why turn
        back in the face of difficulty? Do we not have Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help to protect us? Take courage, generous souls; your Mother will help
        you. Do you not see that She presents you to the Infant Jesus? And why,
        except to incite us to the practice of virtue? The knowledge that his
        king is watching him gives courage to the warrior in combat. Thus, when
        good is made difficult for us When we are about to weaken, let us fix
        our glance on the image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The sight of the
        adorable Infant Whom one day must reward us and encourage us, and we
        will have the courage to practise the most heroic virtues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children of Mary, would you like to be truly virtuous but always find in
        your interior that reserve of self-love that poisons your good works?
        Invoke Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and in a little while, your spirit,
        like Hers, will seek nothing but God's good pleasure and glory. Are you
        the target of continuous contradictions? Do you lack patience? Invoke
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help frequently, and you will be meek and humble
        of heart. Is it your desire to live detached from all disordered
        affections for creatures, but that miserable heart always takes delight
        in the vanities of this world? Invoke Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and
        you will grasp the vanity of everything created. The white lily of
        chastity has enamoured you -- do you want to preserve it immaculately or
        acquire it again if, through misfortune, you lost? Invoke Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help, and soon you will be singing within yourself to Him, Who
        grazes among the lilies. " As the lilies among thorns, so is my beloved
        among the daughters." Faith, hope, and charity, queen of virtues, wish
        to place their Thorne in your heart? Who will grant you that favour but
        the Virgin Who bears on her forehead the star of faith and the cross
        that is all our hope, and in Her arms, the love of the Divine Jesus? The
        wound of an insult received does not want to heal in your heart? Invoke
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and you will succeed in doing good to those
        who offended you. Finally, are you in the flower of your age? Does the
        choice of a way of life concern you? Pray to Her like other souls whom
        She has helped, enlightening them about the world's vanities and
        enkindling in them the love of their God, to the point of abandoning
        everything and consecrating themselves to the Lord through the sacred
        vows of religion. And finally, if you have chosen your vocation and wish
        to work out your sanctification in the world, make yourself a devotee of
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and you will attain it.
      </p>
      <p>
        O with what speed those who consecrate themselves to the veneration of
        Our Lady advance on the part of perfection! That precious devotion seems
        to give them wings to fly to the heights of sanctity; let the priests
        who have inculcated it in their penitent speak about it. Only in Heaven
        will it be known how many souls have reached perfection through that so
        easy means. Dedicate yourselves, then, pious souls, from now on, to the
        service of that gracious Mother, and one day you will be Her crown in
        glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O my Mother of Perpetual Help! How is it possible that I must be so
        wicked with Thy being so holy? Today I do not come to ask for temporal
        good of Thee, but things more pleasing to Thy Heart. Thou art most
        humble; attain for me, then, humility and love for contempt. Thou, Who
        was most patient in the afflictions of life, obtain for me patience in
        adversities. Thou, Who lived always withdrawn from everything created,
        obtain for me detachment from all creatures. Thou, who was always pure
        and spotless, attain for me a perfect purity of heart. Thou, Who was
        filled with love for God, attain for my gift of the holy and pure love.
        Thou, Who was all charity for Thy neighbour, grant that I may have a
        holy and efficacious love for my brothers. Thou, Who was always united
        to the will of God, obtain the same grace for me, above all in my choice
        of a state of life and complete conformity with all the disposition of
        Divine Providence. In a word, O Most holy of creatures, make me a saint!
        These are the graces I beg of Thee. Do not let me weaken in the practice
        of virtue, O Mary my Mother, my love, my life, my refuge, my
        consolation, my Perpetual Help. Amen.
      </p>

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        Interior afflictions were tormenting a woman of Finales to the extent
        that she suffered grave harm to her peace and health. Having heard, in
        1873, of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and of the numerous graces She
        lavished, she took several small images. With her father's consent, she
        made a vow to go to Rome for a visit to the sanctuary of Our Lady if she
        recovered tranquillity in her soul. The Blessed Virgin heard her. Hardly
        had she formulated her vow when she felt free of her interior
        sufferings, and, together with peace, her strength returned, sleep,
        appetite, and in a word, the health of soul and body.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
