      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Four</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help defends her devotees in temptations.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Consider that one of the major difficulties in which man needs the
        perpetual help of Mary especially is in temptation, that perpetual and
        provoking struggle in which we are engaged against the enemies of our
        salvation. We all, the just and the sinners, feel inclined to evil.
        After being carried up to the third heaven, St. Paul himself exclaimed:
        " Unhappy man that I am. I see another Law in my members, fighting
        against the laws of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin. A
        sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, was given to buffet me." Perhaps,
        my friend, you could use the same language; you, too, feel this dismal
        law of sin that wants to dominate the spirit, those vehement impulses of
        passions hungering for pleasure; Satan and a deceiving world hold out
        chains to you too, and at times you find yourself in great danger of
        succumbing to the very violence of temptation. O then, what constraints,
        what straits are those to the soul who wants to be saved; it finds
        itself surrounded by so many and such powerful enemies; it feels its
        weakness and frailty, and with all that, it has to defeat all its
        enemies together, under pain of being lost, perhaps for eternity! How
        critical a position!
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians, what will you do in this terrible struggle with the world,
        the flesh and the devil? Will you surrender your arms, declaring
        yourself defeated? No, that would be great and criminal cowardice. Ah!
        Let that not be your conduct! Instead, let us have recourse to Our Lady,
        and Her Perpetual Help will attain victory for us. It is related that
        Emperor Constantine, having to face a decisive battle against Maxentius,
        an enemy of the Christians, lifted his eyes to heaven and saw in the sky
        a brilliant cross with this inscription: " In this sign shalt thou
        conquer." And the complete routing of Maxentius verified it. Christian
        soul, you are continually at war with so many enemies; heaven presents
        you with the same banner in the image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
        Look at the veil that covers the virginal forehead of the Heavenly
        Queen; on it, you will also see a cross that promises you the most
        powerful help of the merciful Mother of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mary is terrible against the power of Hell, Like an army in battle
        array. She is the tower of David, constructed with ramparts from which
        hang a thousand shields. Against this tower, the sharp arrows of the
        enemy will break. She is the one Who crushes the head of the infernal
        serpent, and the powers of hell flee, simply on hearing Her most holy
        Name pronounced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian, have you looked for some time with reflection upon the image
        of Our Lady of Perpetual Help? Does not Her sight remind you of the
        prodigies worked in other times by the ark of the lord? Truly, the ark
        of the Covenant was coved with pure gold; it contained the manna that
        fell from heaven, and two angels covered it with their white wings. By
        means of the ark of the lord, the people of God attained their
        victories; the walls of Jericho crumbled; the Philistines were defeated;
        because the holy ark was with Israel. Well then, do you not see the gold
        of divine charity glow in the same way in the loving Heart of that
        kindest of a mother? Do you not see Jesus, the sweet manna of our souls,
        in Her maternal arms? Do you not see the angels in the background of
        that picture with their wings extended? Is it not by means of Her most
        powerful help that so many Christians have attained victory over their
        enemies? How many souls adorned with the grace of the lord would be sunk
        in sin if they had not invoked Our Lady of Perpetual Help at the moment
        of temptation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, O Christian soul, make a firm resolution never to enter into
        combat with the enemies of your salvation alone, but rather accompanied
        by Most Holy Mary; Her Perpetual Help will serve as your shield, and
        thus you will attain innumerable other victories in as many battles as
        you must endure. O Mother of Perpetual Help! Thou art the holy Ark of
        the Lord; with Thee, we will win victories; before Thee, the enemies of
        our salvation will flee terrified; in every temptation, we will invoke
        Thy Perpetual Help, and Thou will help us perpetually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O my Mother of Perpetual Help! I bless and thank my God for having
        inspired me with such confidence in Thee because I know this confidence
        is a pledge of salvation for me. Oh! How unfortunate for me! If I have
        fallen into sin in the past, it is for not having recourse to Thee. I
        hope I have been pardoned through the merits of Jesus and Thy powerful
        intercession. But I can again lose the grace of God; the danger has not
        ceased; the enemy does not sleep. O, how many new temptations remain for
        me to overcome? O most sweet sovereign! Protect me, receive me under Thy
        mantle, do not let me fall. Grant me Thy Perpetual Help, and obtain the
        grace that, in all the assault of Hell, I will not forget to invoke
        Thee, repeating without ceasing: " Mother of&nbsp; Perpetual Help, do
        not let me lose my God." Amen.
      </p>

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        In Rome, two brothers, sons of good parents, on a certain day had a
        dispute in which they became inflamed to such a degree that one of them
        took a stiletto (a type of short three-edged sword) to wound the other.
        A sister of the unfortunate youths who witnessed the scene gave a cry of
        fear and exclaimed in a tone of unspeakable sorrow: " My Mother of
        Perpetual Help, have mercy on us!" Scarcely had the young men heard this
        invocation, and in spite of the fury that carried him away, he threw
        down the fratricidal weapon and, with the meekness of a lamb, embraced
        his brother, saying to him calmly: " Let us make peace! I beg you!" The
        pious sister picked up the stiletto and took it to the altar of Our Lady
        as a trophy of the victory that the powerful Queen had just won over one
        of the most terrible passions of the human heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
