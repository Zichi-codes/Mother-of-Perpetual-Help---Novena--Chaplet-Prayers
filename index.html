      <h2>About Our Lady of Perpetual Help</h2>
      <p>
        This devotion to Our Lady of Perpetual Help has been a source of comfort
        and hope to the faithful for centuries. Our Blessed Mother is the symbol
        of love, mercy, and intercession for all who seek her aid.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Confraternity of Our Mother of Perpetual Help is an international
        organization with roots dating back to the late 1800s. According to
        tradition, the original icon was created in Crete in the 14th century,
        was stolen, and was eventually brought to the church of St. Matthew in
        Rome. For 300 years it resided in that church and survived the church’s
        destruction by Napoleon’s army in the late 1700s. Pope Pius IX entrusted
        the original icon to the Redemptorists in 1866 and with it the
        responsibility of “making her known throughout the world.” As a result,
        this image of Mary is the most recognizable image of the Mother of God
        in the world. Today the original icon is permanently enshrined in the
        Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori in Rome, Italy. Hundreds of thousands of
        people gather for the weekly devotions in honor of Our Mother of
        Perpetual Help in Redemptorists churches and parishes all over the
        world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under this Confraternity: Members are assured of the constant protection
        of Our Mother of Perpetual Help. Members are endowed with an influence
        almost miraculous for the softening and converting of obstinate sinners.
        Members share in the indulgences and spiritual privileges granted to the
        members of the archconfraternity in Rome. Finally, by the express will
        of the Superior General of the Redemptorist Fathers and brothers, the
        members have a special share in the fruits and merits of the missions,
        pious exercises, apostolic labors, prayers, penances, and other good
        works without exception which are performed by the entire congregation
        of the Redemptorist Fathers and Brothers.
