            and dear to me. Receive us as your children, I beg of you, 0 Mother
            of God. Keep us under your protection, especially at the hour of our
            death. O Mother of Mercy, I appoint you the mistress and ruler of my
            whole household, my family, my interests, my affairs. Please do not
            refuse this charge. Bless me and all my loved ones, and never allow
            us to be far from your son.

          <h3>Prayer for Ourselves</h3>
          <p>
            O Holy Virgin Mary, who, in order to inspire us with boundless
            confidence hast been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of
            Perpetual Help. I implore thee to come to my aid always and
            everywhere in my temptations, after my difficulties in all my
            miseries of life and above all, at the hour of my death. Give me,
            loving Mother, the desire, no more than the habit always to have
            recourse to thee, for I feel assured that if I invoke thee with
            fidelity, thou wilt be faithful and come to my assistance. Obtain
            for me these graces, the grace to pray to thee without season and
            with childlike confidence, that by virtue of this faithful prayer I
            may ensure thy perpetual help and perseverance. Bless me, O loving
            and helpful Mother, and pray for me now and at the hour of my death.
            Amen.

          <p>
            Trusting in thy goodness O Mother of Perpetual Help, because thou
            art the Mother of mercy, we beseech thee to look with pitying eyes
            upon those outside the fold of the one true Church. O Virgin Mother,
            seat of wisdom, enlighten the minds of our separated brethren, that
            they may come to know the consoling truths of our holy faith and by
            God's grace accept and believe them. O Mary, grant this wondrous
            favor, that all immortal souls ransomed by the blood of thy Son, may
            be united to us in the bonds of Divine charity so that there may be,
            but one flock and one shepherd. Amen.

            O Sweet Mother of Perpetual Help, your holy Child whom you bear in
            your arms will not refuse any of your request. Present to Him.......
            for whom I pray. O good Mother, say only a word to your Son and the
            sick will be healed. Please Mother, refuse me not, nor this act of
            kindness for.......... who though does not merit your special mercy
            but, then, if it is, that God want him/her in this way, may His will

          <h3>Prayer for Peace in the Family</h3>
          <p>
            O Mother of Perpetual Help, look at the kind of peace that existed
            in the family you lived in Nazareth, your unity with your holy Child
            and St Joseph. Look down from heaven upon our family. Grant that we
            live together in peace and love. Obtain for us the spirit to lay and
            give good examples to one another. Grant that we seek happiness
            through having confidence in God's mercy; we shall then exalt in
            that heavenly blessing which God promised to those who do His will.
            Mary, Queen of Peace, bless us. Amen.

          <h3>Prayer for Perseverance</h3>
          <p>
            O Mother of Perpetual Help and my own beloved Mother, I thank thee
            for all the blessings and graces thou hast obtained for me since my
            birth, especially during all my temptations. And now, to so many
            former favors, vouchsafe, O Mary, to add of admitting me though most
            unworthy, into the number of thy special clients, that with them I
            may prove to thee my devotion of veneration and love. Thou shall
            always be, next after God, my only hope, and the object most dear to
            my heart. In all my wants, in all my straits and temptations, I will
            ever have recourse to thee. Thou shall be my refuge and my
            consolation. I desire in all the combats, afflictions, and weariness
            of life to have no other support but God and thee. I would rather be
            one of thy servants than have the whole world at my command; my
            ambition shall be to serve thee, to bless thee, to love thee till my
            last breath. Thou, who art the Mother of perseverance, obtain for me
            the grace rather to die than to have the misfortune of abandoning
            thee. O Mary, I trust thou hast accepted and ratified this offering
            I make thee of all my life; it rests with thee now to protect me
            against my inconstancy; this thou wilt do, and then I shall have the
            happiness to go to meet thee one day in heaven, never more to be
            separated from thee.
            <br />
            <br />
            O Jesus and Mary, to suffer for you, to die for you, to be all
            yours, such is my desire. O Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that I
            remain faithful to thee till my last breath. Amen.

          <p>
            O Mother of Perpetual Help, thou knowest the temptation which
            befalls me now. O good Mother, come quickly to my aid, so that I
            will not yield to this temptation and so lose my soul. Without God's
            grace I cannot be saved; I know that I cannot on my own overcome
            temptations, so dearest Mother, without delay, speed now to save me.
            Remove from my mind all sinful thoughts and instill therein your
            love and power. O Mother of Perpetual Help, I surrender myself to
            you. Protect me from Satan who tempts me constantly to sin. I prefer
            to die rather than offend God through sin. Amen.

          <h3>Prayer for the Conversion of Sinners</h3>
          <p>
            Mother of Perpetual Help, you know so well the value of an immortal
            soul. For every soul has been redeemed by the precious blood of your
            divine Son. Hear my prayer as I plead for the conversion of a
            sinner, one who is quickly heading to eternal ruin. I know that you
            are the refuge of sinners. I know also that God has given you the
            power to bring about the conversion of even the most hardened
            sinner. Until now, nothing has been successful in changing the
            person's sinful way of life.
            <br />
            <br />
            Obtain from your Son the grace of conversion. Merciful Mother, you
            have brought about the conversion of many sinners through the
            prayers of their relatives and friends. Listen to my prayer and
            bring about a true conversion for this unhappy soul. Mother of
            Perpetual Help; show that you really are the Refuge of sinners.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>In Sickness</h3>
          <p>
            Mother of Perpetual Help, you know how much I suffer because of my
            sickness. Not only my body but my soul is also affected. I do not
            even have the strength to pray as I should. Nothing gives me any
            relief. Even the visits and compassion of my friends bring me no
            comfort. My courage is beginning to fail; impatience and sadness are
            having their effect on me.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most tender and loving Mother, in my feelings of distress, I put all
            my trust in you. Your compassionate heart will surely have pity on
            me. Merciful Mother, do not forget your devoted, afflicted child's
            <em>(here mention your sickness)</em>
            . Ask your Son, Jesus, to give me the courage and strength to accept
            my sickness as the will of God and to bear it with patience and
            resignation.
            <br />
            <br />
            If it is God's will, intercede for me in recovering my former good
            health; but if it is God's will that I continue to suffer, or, that
            this sickness should lead me to a better life, I am perfectly
            resigned. Loving Mother, I am confident you will obtain the grace to
            do whatever God asks of me. Amen.

            <br />
            Dear Mother, we are not asking for wealth or prosperity, but merely

            of heaven and earth, and, as such, the dispenser of so many favours

            Mother, and promise to make your perpetual help known far and wide.

            that concerns my future. For then I know I shall succeed in working
            out my eternal salvation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Guide and direct me in choosing the vocation in which I may best
            fulfill God's divine plan here on earth, and be assured of seeing
            and possessing Him for all eternity. Amen.
