      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Nine</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help assists Her devotees in Purgatory.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Will the exercise of Mary's mercy be limited, by chance, to the
        threshold of eternity or before the tribunal of Jesus Christ? Oh no!
        Remember that Her help is perpetual. With maternal solicitude, She
        continues working on our behalf until She sees us at Her side in glory.
        This compassionate Mother helps Her devotees in all the necessities of
        life and at death and in Purgatory. Since the imprisoned souls need
        greater help because they are more tormented and cannot be relieved by
        their efforts, this Queen of mercy busies Herself with greater efficacy
        in helping them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, hearing Her most holy name alleviates those unhappy
        prisoners. They are consoled by thinking that the help of their Mother
        is perpetual and that it extends, therefore, even to that horrifying
        prison. One day, Jesus told Her, as St. Bridget heard it: " Thou art My
        Mother, the Mother of mercy, the consolations of those who find
        themselves in Purgatory;" and the Blessed Virgin said to the saint
        mentioned above, just as the words of comfort she addresses to a poor,
        sick, afflicted and abandoned one, on his bed of sorrow, delights him,
        so also were those souls consoled with just hearing her name. For Her
        dear children, this name is a great relief in that prison, for which
        they invoke it often. And the loving Mother, on hearing them invoke it,
        provides them with Her maternal help, directs Her pleas to God with
        which many souls are helped and refreshed, as with heavenly dew, in
        their great sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, as sovereign Queen, She exercises in that prison Her dominion
        and the fullness of Her powers, not only to relieve but also to free
        from their pains those holy prisoners. And regarding relieving them, St.
        Bernadine of Siena, applying to the matter we are dealing with, those
        words of Ecclesiasticus, " I have walked in the waves of the seas, "
        This is, visiting and helping in the necessities and pains of My
        devotees, who are My children. The pains of Purgatory may be called
        waves, " adds the aforementioned saint, " that never pass, and they may
        be called waves of the sea because they are very bitter pains."
      </p>
      <p>
        Afflicted by those pains, the devotees of Mary are often visited and
        aided by Her. Mary Herself revealed to St. Bridget that She was the
        Mother of all the souls that are found in Purgatory because all the
        pains they deserve for the offences they committed in life, in a
        specific manner, are mitigated, hour by hour, by Her pleas. The
        compassionate Mother does not disdain to descend at times to that holy
        prison to visit and console Her afflicted children. How important is it,
        then, to dedicate oneself to the veneration of that kindest Queen, since
        Her devotees are not forgotten in the purifying flames of Purgatory!
      </p>
      <p>
        But Mary not only consoles, aids and visits Her children in that prison
        of expiation, but also, at times, She takes them away from there to
        carry them to Heaven. On the day of Her glorious assumption, one pious
        tradition holds, Purgatory was left vacant because Mary had asked and
        obtained from Jesus Christ the privilege of taking with Her to glory all
        the souls grieving in that place where fire purifies all stains. And it
        is a matter of faith that with Her plea and petitions, She has the
        singular privilege of freeing, as it pleases Her, the souls in
        Purgatory, especially those of Her most devoted children. Be a sincere
        devotee of this tender Mother so you, too, may feel the sweet effects of
        Her maternal help when you are in Purgatory. Even more: ask Her to grant
        you, before death, the grace of making an act of such perfect love that
        you may fly to Heaven without even passing through those purifying
        flames
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! O Thou Who does never abandon Thy children
        and help them perpetually in life, in death, and even in Purgatory
        itself, behold here at Thy feet a poor sinner filled with confidence has
        recourse to Thee and gives himself to Thee. Many and great sins I have
        committed; I hope, O my Mother, that they have been forgiven, but I do
        not know if I have done for them the penance due, and I may likely have
        to continue expiating them in Purgatory. Ah, if such would be my lot, do
        not stop visiting me in that terrible prison; console me then and
        alleviate my pains. Finally, be my perpetual help until you see me in
        Heaven, praising Thee and singing of Thy mercies for all eternity. Amen.

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        Austria 1876: A God-fearing woman had a son of evil character and bad
        habits. He was apt to reply to maternal advice: " I know what I must
        do." One day, the Mother, filled with confidence, made a pilgrimage to
        Catzelsdodrf, some four leagues distant, by a laborious road, to a
        sanctuary of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. As soon as she arrived before
        the altar of the Virgin, she knelt and prayed for a long time, begging
        with abundant tears for the conversion of her son. Meanwhile, her son,
        who remained at home, began to feel a sudden change of heart, together
        with great confidence in Her Who is the refuge of sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good Mother returned to her home, related what she had seen and
        heard, and spoke of her emotion in the presence of the divine image. The
        prodigal son, hearing this, could not resist grace and resolved to make
        that same pilgrimage as soon as possible. He did it alone and without
        his Mother's knowledge of it. Our Lady finished what she had begun,
        granting to that unfortunate one the grace of a sincere contrition and a
        good confession as a reward for that act of virtue. Reconciled with his
        God, he received Communion and returned home. It was his luck that he
        had not been deaf to the voice of God, for a little later, he was a
        victim in a sad accident and died suddenly. His poor Mother was ignorant
        of this conversion. How great, then, was her bitter and inconsolable
        sorrow, believing her son had died in the sins of his past. She could do
        nothing but weep day and night.
      </p>
      <p>
        But She, Who had saved the sinner, did not leave the pious Mother
        without consolation. One night she saw her son in her dreams. He was in
        Purgatory, and from the midst of the flames, he extended his arms,
        crying" " My Mother, my Mother, I am not condemned, but I suffer
        horribly in this place. Go, I beg you, on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of
        Catzelsdorf!"
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as she awoke, the poor woman, without concerning herself with
        her duties, went to the Church mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prostrate at the feet of the Virgin, after having received Holy
        Communion, she prayed fervently for her dead son. And then she learned
        from his confessor: what she has been ignorant of, that a few days
        before, her son too had come to pray before the protective image, and
        had not returned to his house without having reconciled himself with God
        and prepared himself for death.
      </p>
      <p>
        On hearing such happy news, her grief was transformed into pure joy.
        Praising and blessing the merciful Mother, she went to relate everywhere
        the wonders worked by Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, Mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
