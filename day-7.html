      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Seven</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help grants Her devotees fidelity in Her
        <br />
        service.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Perseverance! A great problem, a major question of life and death, a
        perpetual torment of souls who want to be saved. Have you not said
        trembling - on seeing yourself surrounded by so many dangers, and above
        all, on seeing souls that seemed confirmed in good fall away, on feeling
        violent passions inflamed, and on examining your fickleness - have you
        not said: " O, will I be saved? Have my sins been forgiven? I hope so.
        Am I in the grace of God? Will I persevere in good until the end? What
        will be my sentence at the judgement? Will I be found among the
        predestined? And, finally, what will be my lot in eternity?" Terrifying
        reflections, questions whose uncertain replies fill the heart with
        anxiety. St Teresa, writing on this point, could not understand why the
        pen did not fall from her hand. After having preached to others, St.
        Paul feared that he would be among the reprobate, and St Jerome
        responded beforehand to the sound of the trumpet of final judgement with
        cries of terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        How, then, to get rid of this annoying doubt? How to find a guarantee of
        tranquillity? A great saint tells us: " Of what value is it to stir up
        these questions disputed by the wise ones concerning whether you will be
        saved or lost? If we are true children of Mary, certainly we will be
        among the chosen ones." This is the doctrine of all the Doctors of the
        church. It is impossible for one who counts on the most powerful help of
        Mary to be condemned. A consoling words that should fill us with
        confidence and devotion. But this is understood on the condition that
        one lives without sins or desires at least to cease sinning; if someone
        wants to sin with the hope that the Blessed Virgin will save him through
        his own faults, he will make himself unworthy, incapable of Her
        protection. It is true, then, O Mother of Perpetual Help, that if I am
        Thy faithful servant, without a doubt, I will be saved. I will serve
        Thee; then, I will love Thee; I will invoke Thee always.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, Christian soul, you are still not at peace concerning your
        perseverance; you must still fear one thing. Without doubt, Most Holy
        Mary will save you if you invoke Her, but will you be faithful in Her
        service? Will you, one day, cease to be Her devotee? So great is the
        fickleness of our heart that tomorrow you will give up what today you
        have begun. Have, perchance, all those who were devotees of the Virgin,
        in the beginning, persevered in Her service? There is a remedy for this
        great misery, called inconstancy, in Our Lady of Perpetual Help. She is
        the one Who must help us to persevere in her service. If all graces pass
        through the hands of Mary, why would not this most special grace of all
        graces, that of invoking her perpetually, also pass through them? And
        the very name of Perpetual Help, is it, not almost a sure guarantee that
        she will help us perpetually? How could we weaken in her love and forget
        Her? If a mother, according to nature, knew that a child of hers could
        not be happy without enjoying the attentions of his mother, what would
        she not do to keep him at her side? Well then, our august Queen knows
        that there cannot be happiness for us, her very beloved children,
        without having fidelity in Her service, which is intimately united to
        the service of the lord, and that is why She provides Her devotees with
        His paternal help, abundantly and perpetually.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a soul who has been at one time Her devotee wishes to abandon Her,
        that tender Mother waits at the door of his heart and knocks until it is
        opened, until the unfaithful one returns to his primitive fervour. We
        have an infallible means of assuring ourselves of perseverance in the
        devotion to Mary; it suffices to ask Her for the grace to call on Her
        always, to ask Her for the grace today, to ask Her tomorrow and every
        day. In short, O soul devoted to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, engrave in
        your memory that maxim of the great doctor, St. Alphonsus: " I am sure
        that I will be saved if I sincerely invoke Mary; I am sure of invoking
        Her if I ask of Her grace to do so always, and I will not tire of
        repeating this petition of imploring Her with fidelity."
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us conclude, then, by saying with St. Bernard: " O man, whomever you
        may be, do not forget that, rather than walking on earth, you go
        fluctuating between dangers and tempests; if you do not want to be
        immersed, do not take your eyes away from this star: Mary. Look at Her
        often. When in danger of sinning, in the anguish of temptations, in
        doubts concerning things you must resolve, remember that Mary can assist
        you, and call on Her right away, so She may help you. Never let her
        powerful name leave your heart so that it may inspire you with
        confidence, nor your lips so that you may invoke it. Follow Mary, and
        you will not stray from the path of salvation; commend yourself to Her,
        and you will not lose confidence; if Her hand sustains you, you will not
        fall; if She is your guide, you will be saved without effort; and
        finally, if Mary takes your defence, undoubtedly you will arrive at the
        kingdom of the blessed. Do this, and you will live." Amen
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O my Mother of Perpetual Help! In Thy hands I place my poor soul; I
        entrust to Thee my perseverance; intercede for me, an unhappy sinner.
        Take me under Thy protection, and this will suffice for me. Indeed, if
        Thou protects me, I have nothing to fear. I do not fear my sins because
        Thou will remedy the evil they have caused me. I do not fear the devils
        because Thou art more powerful than all Hell. I do not even fear my
        judge Himself because Thou will appease His just indignation by one word
        from thee. No, I do not fear anything. O! Despite all this, my Mother,
        one fear, assaults me. And it is that of forgetting Thee, of ceasing,
        one day, to call Thee to my aid, and thus to be lost for all eternity.
        O, my tender Mother! Obtain for me the grace of commending myself to
        Thee always; and if now Thou foresees that one day I will abandon Thee,
        let me die today at Thy feet, before the world may be a witness to such
        great ingratitude. But no, O Mother, I will not forget Thee; I would
        rather die, that my right hand wither, that my tongue be paralyzed than
        not one day go to sing Thy mercies forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        In a certain city in England, a man, completely given to drinking, used
        to come home every day intoxicated. One day his unhappy wife, tired of
        all she was suffering from her husband's perversity, lamented her lot
        before a devotee of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The latter moved to
        compassion and gave a medal of that Virgin to the afflicted wife,
        advising her to light a candle in honour of Her dear Mother every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman promised to do so and recited the holy rosary before the
        miraculous medal. Her husband returned that day late, as was his custom,
        but not intoxicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some time had passed, the woman related to her pious advisor, who
        was asking her about her husband: " Since I began to honour Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help, he has amended; he returned to his vice only once when,
        distractedly, I forgot to fulfil the promise I made to the Mother of
        God." Thus, the blessed Virgin rewards Her devotees.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, Mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
