      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Three</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual help assists Her devotees to overcome Lukewarmnss
      </strong>
      <p>
        Yesterday, we saw how great is the tenderness of Our Lady with great
        sinners, but it is no less great with another class of souls in need,
        those who are called tepid and are in a state almost as dangerous as
        that of mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these negligent souls, who at times frequent the sacraments, do
        indeed wish to avoid mortal sin, nevertheless, they do not try to serve
        God, filling their lives with voluntary venial sins; with
        superficiality, they recite their prayers and carry out other devotions;
        they hear mass, perhaps go to confession and receive Communion, but they
        do it out of routine and for human considerations; without fruit,
        without advancing in virtue; anger, lies, murmurings, rash judgements,
        nasty words, envies, laziness, vanity, impurities, dangerous and useless
        conversations, disordered attachment to the things of the world and
        other similar faults easily find their place in the hearts of tepid
        persons. Think of the great risk of being condemned for being in this
        state. St. Teresa saw the place for which she was destined in Hell if
        she were not more fervent. In the opinion of St. Chrysostom, we must
        have more fear of habitual venial sins than mortal sins because, says
        this great saint, mortal sin is monstrous and inspires horror. At the
        same time, tepidity leaves us calm and unconcerned. And was it not
        perchance against tepidity that Our lord has proffered these tremendous
        words:" I would that thou wert cold," that is, that you would be in
        mortal sin! Who would believe it if God Himself had not said it?" But
        because thou art lukewarm, I&nbsp; will begin to vomit thee out of my
        mouth." Who does not have a horror of vomit? That is why St. Gregory
        writes:" I do not despair of seeing a sinner, as yet unconverted, saved;
        but rather for the salvation of a soul that has fallen into tepidity." A
        terrible sentence that the doctors confirm when they teach that it is
        almost impossible for a tepid soul to be converted. O, careless soul! It
        is sufficient to commit a habitual sin deliberately to be tepid and to
        find oneself in this danger. What will become of you who commit so many
        faults with as much ease as thirsty swallow water? But then, the soul
        who finds itself in the state will say to me: " Is there then no remedy
        for me, and must I abandon myself to despair?"
      </p>

      <p>
        O, unfortunate soul! It is difficult for you to be converted. But with
        all that, do not despair. Consider that what is impossible on Earth is
        not so in Heaven. If you wish with all the earnestness of your will to
        throw off this dismal yoke, I will tell you a way as efficacious as it
        is easy. Lift your glance; contemplate the image of your most kind
        Mother of Perpetual Help. Do you not see a brilliant star on Her
        forehead? It is the symbol of your hope. Place your confidence in Her,
        begin to serve Her with fidelity, and you will feel your heart
        transformed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devotion to this Mother of fair love is incompatible with culpable
        negligence. O, how many souls have given up their tepidity on the same
        day they have begun to be Her devotees? What is lacking to you is the
        powerful love that fears to displease the lovable Jesus, for She is the
        Mother of this fervent charity that beautifies souls. She wishes to
        grant it to you more than you want to receive it. Do you want the
        miracle of Cana re-enacted for you? Invoke Her with love. She will
        present you to the Divine Infant Who rests in Her arms, saying to Him: "
        Vinum non habent."(They have no wine) " My son, see this poor soul who
        does not have true love." And then your coldness will be converted into
        a fervour, as the water was converted into wine. Our Lady will inspire
        in you a living desire to concentrate yourself without reserve to the
        lord; She will give you a special delight in meditating on eternal
        truths; She will communicate to you a singular devotion to the August
        Sacrament of our altar; and thus you will be able to break the chains
        that imprison you and again be the delight of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!

      <h3>EJACULATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! Do not let me fall into tepidity, and if by

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        Behold me here, O my Mother. I am one of those unhappy souls who deserve
        to find myself abandoned by Thy Son, and by Thee, in the miserable state
        of tepidity, I have lived for so many years. However, the new lights
        that He imparts to me today through Thy intercession and that mysterious
        voice that calls me to serve Him fervently are signs that He has not yet
        abandoned me. O Mother most kind! I have no&nbsp; fervour; I do not love
        Jesus as I should love Him, and nevertheless, I want to be all His.
        Please help me to consider venial sin in extreme horror; make me
        fervent. Pray, do not cease praying for me so that I leave my tepidity
        and serve God with fervour until attaining Heaven, where I will be safe
        from all danger of losing God, sure of loving Him always, and of loving
        Thee, also, O Mother of Perpetual Help, for all eternity. Amen
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you see? Oh, man! Whomever you may be and in whatever occupation you
        find yourself, you have no reason to be discouraged; find in Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help a kindest Mother, Who helps you in your miseries if you
        confide in Her; She will help you continually until seeing you one day
        seated at Her side in Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Thou be blessed, then, Lord, for in Thine infinite mercy Thou hast
        given us Thy Blessed Mother as a refuge and opportune aid in every
        tribulation, and blessed is She Who is the Perpetual Help of the exiled
        children of Eve in this valley of tears. O Mother of Perpetual Help,
        what consolations and sweetness the soul feels when pronouncing Thy
        name! For the tongue that utters it, it is an exquisite honey; for the
        ear that hears it, a harmonious melody; and for the heart that savours
        it, the purest and holy joy.
      </p>

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        A figure of tepidity, consumption, that terrible illness that even today
        mocks human science, afflicted a young North American woman for five
        years, during two of which she was unable to get up from her bed. Both
        lungs were affected, and one of them was almost completely lost. Several
        eminent doctors had declared that there remained no hope of saving her
        and that no more could be done to alleviate the poor sick girl's
        suffering. But she, having heard of the extra-ordinary cures due to the
        invocation of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, felt inspired with great
        confidence in Her, and she begged her mother to begin a novena in the
        church of the Redemptorist Fathers, where the miraculous image was
        venerated. On the ninth day, when the mother was preparing to go and
        make the last visit to the image, the sick one asked permission to
        accompany her. The poor mother, believing the girl was delirious,
        abstained from giving in to her. But behold, at that moment, the young
        girl arose and dressed without anyone's help. She accompanied her joyous
        mother to the church and, after having prayed with a fervour that is
        easy to imagine at the foot of the altar of her Heavenly liberator, she
        returned to her house perfectly cured. Great was the doctor's surprise
        when making his usual visit when he found the sick girl up, but that
        surprise peaked when he found out that she had left the house in the
        morning. "My daughter is cured; my daughter is cured!" the mother
        repeated, transported with joy. The doctor, a complete unbeliever, did
        not know what to think of what he saw. He examined the lungs
        scrupulously and recognized that they were healthy and intact. When he
        had been told of all that had happened, he could do no less than
        exclaim: " Well then, if there are such things on earth that can be
        called miracles, surely this is one of them."
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
