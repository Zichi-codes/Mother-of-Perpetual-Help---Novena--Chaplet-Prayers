      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Two</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help assists her devotee to cease sinning
      </strong>
      <p>
        Among men, titles are often more than vain designations that do not
        correspond to reality. In Mary, on the contrary, titles always express
        the most obvious truth. And Thus the Blessed Virgin is called and is
        truly the Perpetual Help of all the unfortunate who have recourse to
        Her. Consider, however, that there is one class of Unfortunates for whom
        the most loving Mother seems to reserve her most tender glances and whom
        She makes a special object of Her most compassionate concern: they are
        the poor sinners, and it easy to understand the reason behind that
        predilection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greater a child's misfortune, the more maternal love increases. Well
        then, what greater misfortune is there than being separated from Jesus
        and chained to the shameful slavery of the devil? By losing sanctifying
        grace, the unhappy one has made himself the target of divine anger; the
        ire of God clamours against him, and if death should surprise him, what
        a calamity! His lot will be among the reprobate. That is why the kindest
        of mothers pours out on Her children, the sinners, all the treasures of
        the mercy and tenderness of Her maternal Heart. She attracts them with
        the sweetness of her name: Mother of Perpetual help, with the fame of
        Her miracles and even with her merciful glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many have not felt moved and converted on exchanging glances with
        this miraculous Virgin! That glance, filled with sadness and compassion,
        seems to say to the sinner: Unfortunate one! How long? How long will you
        afflict the tender Son you see in My arms with your offences? How long
        will you offer Him gall and vinegar, rendering His passion and death
        useless? How long will you afflict me, your Mother, and thrust into my
        heart, one after the other, most cruel swords? How long will you persist
        in running toward the eternal abyss? My child, how long? Tender words
        that only the heart hears; wondrous words that illuminate the
        understanding, soften the hardened heart, melt it, and finally, wrest it
        that cry of the repentant prodigal:" I have sinned, My God; forgive me,
        forgive me." His tears flow abundantly; the Virgin presents them to Her
        beloved Son and the sinner is converted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say if it is not so, you who have found repentance, life, pardon, peace
        and joy in your heart before Her image. Is it surprising, then, that
        among the wonders the Virgin of Perpetual Help works every day, the
        stupendous conversions due to Her intercession number in Thousands! So
        certain it is that a pious writer said: "I do not know of any more
        efficacious nor more rapid means to obtain the conversion of a sinner
        than to inspire in him a tender and sincere devotion to Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help." And why would that wonder-working image want to be
        entrusted to a congregation of missionaries, accompanying them to the
        most remote towns and going in search of straying sheep in the most
        unknown and forgotten cottages?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, beloved sinner, no matter the number or gravity of your faults or
        how hardened your heart is, all is not yet lost for you. Lift your
        spirit! Take courage! Have recourse to Our Mother of Perpetual Help, and
        you will obtain forgiveness. She is the most safe refuge of the sinner
        who sincerely wants to return to his God. Tell Her, then, with all your
        heart: " O Mother of Perpetual Help! Filled with confidence in Thy
        kindness and mercy, I throw myself at Thy feet. I come wounded with the
        arrow of repentance. My having offended God grieves me; Mother obtain
        for me true repentance and forgiveness. " You will see that this benign
        Mother will make you return to grace and friendship with your God. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me

      <h2>PRAYER</h2>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! On seeing myself so contemptible and
        stained, I should not dare to come to thee and call Thee my Mother.
        However, I do not want my miseries to deprive me of the consolation and
        the confidence I feel penetrating me upon uttering Thy sweet name. I do
        not deserve Thy hearing me; I am a miserable sinner, but the evil is
        done. Thou cants remedy it. I beg Thee earnestly, my Mother, to come to
        my aid and to have mercy on me. I know Thou lovest even the most
        miserable sinners, and Thou goest in search of them to save them. I
        deserve Hell. It is true: I am the most miserable of sinners, but Thou
        dost not need to come in search of me. I present myself spontaneously
        before Thee with the firm hope that Thou will not reject me. Behold me
        here at Thy feet; my Mother, I will not depart from Thy feet until Thy
        Son has said to me as to Magdalene. "Thy sins are forgiven thee."

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        The following conversion is noteworthy among the many wonders that Our
        Lady of Perpetual Help performed on the island of St. Maurice (Africa).
        A young woman was rolling down the slopes of vice; she abandoned her
        paternal home to give free rein to her passions. Be assured that a human
        creature cannot have ever fallen into an abyss of corruption as deep as
        this unfortunate young islander. Her desolate Mother bewailed in silence
        with bitter tears the perdition of her daughter. She had recourse to the
        Virgin of Perpetual Help to obtain the conversion of the young woman.
        She began a novena. And on the second day, Lo and behold, the young girl
        happened to pass by the Church, entered it, and found herself in front
        of the image of the Blessed Virgin. Despite herself, the image attracted
        the glances of the unhappy sinner. That was sufficient to overcome her;
        torrents of tears flowed from her eyes, her breast choked in sobs, and
        the dart of repentance opened the way to the point of wounding this most
        hardened heart. The loving and afflicted Mother arrived at the Church to
        continue her novena, and what was her surprise and joy on finding her
        daughter there! Transported with joy, she flew in search of the
        missionary priest and returned with great haste in his company to admire
        that Magdalene bathed in tears at the feet of Mary of Perpetual Help, to
        whom the wonder of her conversion was due. This happened in the year
        1871.
      </p>
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, love, Mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
