      <h1>Novena to our Mother of Perpetual Help</h1>
      <h2>Day Eight</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>
        Our Lady of Perpetual Help assists Her devotees at the hour of
        <br />
        death.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Consider that, although man needs the benign help of Mary at all times
        and in all circumstances, never, however, as much as in the anxieties of
        death, which are the greatest that can be experienced in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrible, indeed, very awful, are the afflictions of the dying.
        Everything conspires to make those last moments terrible: the memory of
        sins committed, the fear of the incomprehensible judgements of an
        offended God, the uncertainty of eternal salvation, everything,
        everything. Especially then, Hell arms itself and puts into action all
        its forces to possess the soul that is going to pass into eternity
        because it knows that only a little time remains before it is to be
        judged and that, if it does not succeed in ruining it, it will be saved
        forever. That is why the wicked spirit, accustomed to tempting it in
        life, is not content solely with tempting it at the hour of death but
        even calls his companions to help him. They say that, at the moment of
        St. Andrew Avellino's death, ten thousand devils gathered in his cell to
        tempt him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if, at that time, we have on our side the most powerful help of
        Mary, who will be able to overcome us? And, how will that gracious
        Mother deny us Her aid if we persevere in asking for it? She revealed to
        St. Gertrude that She grants aid to Her devotees, at the point of death,
        for as many times as they have implored Her in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        O, my friend! How fortunate you will be if you find yourself bound by
        the chains of love to Our Lady of Perpetual Help at the critical moment
        of death. These are the chains of salvation and eternal glory. No, that
        tender Mother does not know how to abandon Her true devotees at that
        supreme moment. She is the Mother of Perpetual Help, and just as She has
        helped them in their exile, so also She exhibits Her sweetness at the
        hour of death and obtains a sweet and happy end for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        And above all, showing Herself worthy of the beautiful name She bears,
        She sends the prince St. Michael with all the angels to the aids of Her
        faithful dying children, so they go then to defend them from the snares
        of the devils and receive the souls of all those who have continually
        commended themselves to Her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is not content with sending angels to the aid of Her devotees; She
        will come in person to assist them in their last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that great day when She had good fortune and at the same time the
        sorrow of assisting Her son Jesus, Who is the first of the predestined,
        She obtained the grace of assisting all of them also at the terrible
        moment of death. That is why the Holy Church makes us pray for Her to
        help us, especially in the hour of our death: " Pray for us, sinners,
        now and at the hour of our death."
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is found to conform with what the Blessed Virgin said to St.
        Bridget, speaking of Her devotees: " Then, My daughter, as their
        Mistress and Mother, when they die, I will go out to meet them so they
        may have consolation and comfort." The loving Queen then covers these
        souls with Her mantle and presents them to the judge, Her Son, and thus
        indeed attains salvation for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian, although you may have been a sinner, you will not cease
        experiencing this consolation, provided that, from now on, you manage to
        live well and to serve this gracious and most amiable Lady. In your
        anguish and the temptations with which the devil will assault you at
        death to make you despair, Our Mother of Perpetual Help will give you
        fortitude and come Herself to defend you. And, with such a Mother and
        Protector, what will you fear, O sinner?
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! What will become of me when I am at the
        point of delivering my soul to God? From now on, when I consider my sins
        when I think of that terrible moment that must decide my salvation or my
        eternal perdition, I begin to tremble and become perplexed. O my Mother
        of Perpetual Help! Do not abandon me in that tremendous hour. What will
        become of me if Thou dost abandon me in that supreme moment! O, Holy
        Virgin, my Hope, come to my aid in the tremendous anguish in which I
        will be held prisoner. Fortify me when the devil wants to fling me into
        despair by the memory of the sins I have committed. Obtain for me the
        grace to invoke Thee then more often than ever, so that I may die
        uttering Thy most sweet name, together with that of Thy adorable Son,
        and that I may die in the love of God and Thee, to go afterwards to love
        Thee eternally in Paradise.&nbsp; Amen.
      </p>

    <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
    <p>
      A woman from the pontifical States went one day to Rome to venerate the
      miraculous image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. A priest, to whom she
      addressed herself, asked her the motive that had decided her to undertake
      such a long trip. She answered him: " My husband told me several times
      that a very miraculous image of the Virgin, called Our Lady of Perpetual
      Help, was venerated in this church. He often commended himself to Her and
      received many graces through her intercession. A little while ago, he
      died. He told me he saw Our Lady at his bedside when he approached death.
      He received such consolation from this apparition that he seemed not to
      feel the pains of death, and he died so gently and piously that I do not
      doubt his salvation, and my greatest happiness would be to die as he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
      blessed! May she be my hope, love, mother, refuge, and life. Amen.
