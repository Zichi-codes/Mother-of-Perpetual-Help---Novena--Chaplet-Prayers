      <h2>Day One</h2>
      <h3>ACT OF CONTRITION</h3>

      <p>
        My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, my father and Redeemer,
        behold at Thy feet a poor sinner who has so grievously afflicted Thy
        loving Heart. O lovable Jesus, how could I have offended thee and filled
        with bitterness that Heart that loves me so and that has spared no
        effort to attain my love? How great has been my ingratitude! But, O my
        saviour, be consoled, be consoled, I say to thee; now I find myself
        repentant, such grief I feel for the afflictions I have caused thee,
        that I would like to die of poor sorrow and contrition. O my Jesus! Who
        could have made me weep for sin as Thou hast wept for them in Thy mortal
        life! My soul is oppressed for having offended Thee. Eternal Father, in
        satisfaction for my offences, I offer Thee the affliction and sorrow the
        Heart of Thy Divine Son has felt for them. And Thou, O Loving Jesus!
        Give me such a horror for sin that it may make me avoid even the most
        trifling of faults from now on. Depart from my Heart, earthly
        affections; I do not want to love anything now but my most bountiful
        Redeemer. O my Jesus, help me, strengthen me, and pardon me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Mother of Perpetual Help, intercede for me and obtain for me the
        pardon of my sins.

      <h3>PREPARATORY PRAYER</h3>
      <strong>To be said everyday</strong>
      <p>
        O Most Blessed Virgin Mary! Whom to inspire us with boundless confidence
        has been pleased to take the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help; I
        implore Thee to come to my aid always and everywhere, in my temptations,
        after my falls, in my difficulties, in all the miseries of life, and
        above all, at the hour of my death. Give me, O loving Mother, the
        desire, nay more, the habit always to have recourse to Thee, for I feel
        assured that if I am faithful in invoking Thee, Thou will be faithful in
        coming to my assistance. Obtain for me, then, this grace of graces, the
        grace to pray to Thee without ceasing and with childlike trust, that, by
        means of my constant plea, I may ensure Thy Perpetual Help and final
        perseverance. Bless me, O tender and solicitous Mother, pray for me now
        and at the hour of my death. Amen

      <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
      <strong>The Title Our Lady of Perpetual Help</strong>
      <p>
        Among the numerous titles under which Christian piety is pleased to
        invoke the Blessed Virgin, there are few that are as likely to lift our
        hearts and fill them with unlimited confidence as the sweet name of
        Mother of Perpetual Help, a name that pleases Her so.
      </p>
      <p>
        To convince you of this: consider, on the one hand, what the life of man
        on earth is, and on the other hand, what the name of Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truthfully, what is life but a chain of miseries, dangers, afflictions
        and labours? In the temporal order, who is exempt from illness or from
        poverty? Who is there who does not have to weep? In the spiritual order,
        who knows how, on every occasion, to be on guard against the great
        misfortune of sin, against the snares of lukewarmness, against the
        coaxing of temptations? Who does not weaken from time to time in the
        service of God, in the practice of virtue, and who does not tire at
        times in the path of good? Finally, what Christian does not tremble at
        the thought of the decisive and difficult moment of death, of the
        purifying fire of purgatory? In view of such miseries and necessities,
        the soul, overwhelmed, feels itself weakening and would like to burst
        into tears. But upon hearing the sweet name of Mother of Perpetual Help,
        it becomes serene; it takes courage and continues joyfully on its path
        toward eternity. Why? Because it then feels that its lamentations are
        not lost in a desert but that they find a gracious echo in the Heart of
        a Mother who desires and can help it. In truth, the Virgin of Perpetual
        Help means a remedy for all the evils that afflict us - a remedy not
        just for a day but perpetual, from the cradle to Heaven, help in
        everything and help at all times. Perpetual Help means consolation in
        afflictions, poverty, illness, and labour; strength to give up sin,
        whether mortal or venial, and not to fall into it again. Perpetual Help
        means fidelity in the service of the lord and of the virgin Herself, and
        therefore, final perseverance. Perpetual Help means courage in the
        practice of virtue; special protection in the terrible hour of death;
        prompt and efficacious relief in the dreadful prison where just souls,
        still indebted to Divine justice, suffer before entering the heavenly
        homeland. Perpetual Help means: that even when circumstances or
        situations occur where everything seems hopeless, there is still one
        certain recourse: the Protection of the Blessed Virgin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meditate and ask for what you wish to obtain from Our Lady of Perpetual
        Help.

      <h3>JOYS</h3>
      <strong>At the end of each Paragraph say:</strong>
      <p>Come hasten to assist me, O Mother sweet and kind!</p>

      <p>
        Thou art Perpetual Help benign;
        <br />
        Come, therefore, I implore Thee:
        <br />
        Come hasten to assist me.
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hear, O Virgin pure,
        <br />
        Our fervent prayers of love
        <br />
        That fly to Thee above
        <br />
        On Thine exalted Throne.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stained by guilt and sin
        <br />
        I bow my head and cry;
        <br />
        And at Thy feet I sigh
        <br />
        for clemency and love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free the careless soul
        <br />
        From it tepid ways,
        <br />
        And set the soul ablaze
        <br />
        with fervour in devotion
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretched in this vale
        <br />
        Of pain and tribulation,
        <br />
        For heavenly consolation
        <br />
        I humbly beg of Thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        If my virtue wanes
        <br />
        When tempests howl and roar,
        <br />
        My energies restore
        <br />
        Beloved Morning Star.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Thy faithful child
        <br />
        Encouragement provide,
        <br />
        And toward virtue guide
        <br />
        His weak unsteady step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free my fickle heart
        <br />
        from all its lassitude,
        <br />
        And grant it fortitude
        <br />
        To lead a sinless life.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final clash
        <br />
        With death in all its fright,
        <br />
        How great my soul's delight
        <br />
        If then I can exclaim:
      </p>

      <p>
        In purgatory's fire,
        <br />
        Dear Mother, please be sweet;
        <br />
        Great Lady, I entreat,
        <br />
        Alleviate my pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grant me, Mother dear,
        <br />
        As fond farewell to Thee,
        <br />
        To sing eternally
        <br />
        With love and praise to Thee:
      </p>

      <p>
        Come hasten to assist me
        <br />
        O Mother sweet and kind!

      <h3>PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O Mother of Perpetual Help! For the ingratitude with which, until now, I
        have repaid Thy mercies and those of God, I deserve, as just punishment,
        Thy depriving me of Thy favours; but, O my sweet Mother, no matter how
        great my ingratitude is, Thy kindness is even greater. Do not disdain,
        therefore, to help a poor sinner who confides in Thee! Thy heart
        overflows with charity for all and never has one heard it said that any
        unfortunate soul had left Thy feet without having his tears dried. Do
        not forget my miseries; intercede for me before the God of goodness, Who
        refuses Thee nothing and prove once more that Thou art worthy of the
        sweet name of Perpetual Help.

      <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
      <p>
        During the last years of the 15th century, when the Turks were
        afflicting the Christians on the isle of Crete with bloody persecutions,
        a pious merchant was obliged to abandon his native soil forever and seek
        asylum under the skies of Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vessel that conveyed him had scarcely reached the high seas when it
        was lashed by a violent tempest, and in a few moments, the hurricane
        tore off its sails, and the raging waves destroyed its rudder. The crew,
        upon seeing their ship lost and made a plaything by the waves, terrified
        and struck with fear, awaited the death that would give the depths of
        the ocean for their tomb.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of that frightful scene, only the merchant of Crete
        appeared to be serene. There was courage in his words, and confidence
        glowed in his eyes. And as the fury increased, the pious traveller ran
        to the ship's interior, found his luggage, and, uttering sighs of hope,
        returned to the deck carrying in his hand the image of Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Look," he exclaimed, addressing the afflicted crew: "Behold the star of
        the sea; behold the beacon of navigators. Let us invoke Her in our
        afflictions. She will save us." Upon saying these words, the merchant
        lifted the precious image before the terrified crew members, who grouped
        themselves on their knees around his feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Petitions rise from the earth, and prodigies descend from heaven",
        according to Saint Augustine.
      </p>
      <p>
        And sure enough: the travellers had hardly invoked Mary with that
        powerful cry of faith when the hurricane stopped the course of its
        winds, and the great ocean calmed its waves. The sun shore in the skies,
        and the ship, rocked by the gentle breeze, went on to drop its anchors
        on the beautiful shores of Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the first wonder about the miraculous image of Our Lady of
        Perpetual Help manifested before the face of Christianity. She wanted to
        commence Her favours in a vanquished tempest, to teach us that, in all
        the torments of life, no matter how lost we feel ourselves to be, She
        will always be our life, our sweetness and our hope. Amen
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        May Our Lady Of Perpetual Help be loved, praised, invoked and eternally
        blessed! May she be my hope, my love, my Mother, My refuge and my life.
        Amen.
